# Guessing Game
[Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com) - Practical Project #1

The first practical project in the [Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com) [Python 3 Masterclass](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/python-3-programming-beginner-to-pro-masterclass) is a very simple guessing game. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 50, which the user tries to guess. The program guides the user toward the true number, by telling them whether their guess was too low, or too high.
